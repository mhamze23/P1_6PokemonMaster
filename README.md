# Pokemon Battle!

We are delighted to present the Pokémon First Generation Generator, a comprehensive tool designed for Pokémon enthusiasts and gamers. This generator offers valuable information about the selected Pokémon character and the most advantageous opponent in battle. Our goal in creating this generator is to pay homage to the legendary Ash Ketchum and his trusty companion, Pikachu, who have now retired. With its user-friendly interface and comprehensive data, the Pokémon First Generation Generator is poised to provide an exceptional experience for all Pokémon fans/gamers.

## How does it work?

To use the Pokémon First Generation Generator, simply enter the name of the desired Pokémon in the designated text box and click "submit." The generator will then promptly display crucial information, including the Pokémon's image, name, type, weaknesses, and the most advantageous opponent for battle, in a clear and concise format on the side of the trainer's screen. In addition, to enhance the user experience, a relevant clip will be displayed at the bottom of the screen to support the request. This intuitive design allows for an effortless and comprehensive approach to acquiring information about the selected Pokémon character.
